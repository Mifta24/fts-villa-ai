# FTS VILLA AI — Reservation Flow

## 1. UX Principle
Reservation must happen inside the fixed full-screen experience.

Do not redirect the customer to a long standalone form.

Use:
- modal
- right-side panel
- scene change
- step-by-step wizard

## 2. Entry Points
Reservation can start from:
- Reception Scene
- Unit Scene
- AI conversation
- Facility / event conversation
- direct reservation quick action

## 3. Required Fields
- Check-in
- Check-out
- Guests
- Number of units
- Preferred unit
- Customer name
- Contact method

Optional:
- children
- special request
- smoking preference
- breakfast
- accessibility needs

## 4. Step Flow

### Step 1 — Dates
Ask:
- check-in
- check-out

### Step 2 — Guests
Ask:
- adults
- children if needed
- number of units

### Step 3 — Unit
Use selected unit if already chosen.

Otherwise:
- ask preference
or
- recommend from known data

### Step 4 — Customer
Ask:
- name
- contact method

### Step 5 — Summary
Show:
- unit
- dates
- guests
- units
- special request
- contact

Then:
- Confirm Request
- Edit
- Back

## 5. Date Validation
Rules:
- check-in cannot be in the past
- check-out must be after check-in
- use villa timezone
- invalid input should be corrected immediately

## 6. Occupancy Validation
Check:
- unit capacity
- number of guests
- number of units

If capacity is exceeded:
- suggest another unit type
- suggest multiple units
- offer staff assistance

## 7. Availability

### If real-time system is connected
Show actual availability.

### If not connected
Use:

> This is a reservation request. Final availability will be confirmed by villa staff.

Never fake availability.
